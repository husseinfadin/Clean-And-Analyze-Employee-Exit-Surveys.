# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys.
Project Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys.

In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education,
Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.<br>
You can find the TAFE exit survey here [links](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE here [links](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).<br>
We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)
